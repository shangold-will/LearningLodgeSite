                                <p>To ensure that online learning occurs in a safe, monitored space, 
                                    we require that a parent or another responsible adult remain in the same room or same residence as the student during tutoring sessions. 
                                    The Zoom meeting invitation for each session will be emailed to the parent, who should plan to be on at the start of the call to check in with the tutor. 
                                    If no adult guardian remains in the residence, the call will be ended by the tutor. 
                                    We recommend that the student uses the computer in a common room like a living room, kitchen, 
                                    or other room with an open door so that the parent is able to check in at any point in time.</p>

                            <li>
                                <h4>For Tutors:</h4>
                                <p>All tutoring sessions should start with the parent checking in with the student and tutor to begin the call. 
                                    Ensure that the parent is present in the residence during tutoring. 
                                    Inform the parent or guardian in advance that the session will be ended if the parent needs to leave the residence. 
                                    Tutors may not do a student's homework for them, but rather guide them towards finding the answer themselves.</p>

                                <p>While we understand the need to be flexible and accommodate schedule changes when possible, 
                                    tutoring is a formal event and needs to be scheduled in advance. 
                                    Please contact your tutor/parent at least 2 hours before a session if you must skip or reschedule. 
                                    Skipping out on sessions without communicating can cause misunderstandings.</p>

                                    must be handled between the tutor and the student’s parent, 
                                    not directly with the student.</p>

                                    Be aware of the student’s surroundings and do not share private or
