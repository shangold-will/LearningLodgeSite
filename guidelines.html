                <h1>Online Tutoring Guidelines</h1>
                <h2>For Parents, Students, and Tutors</h2>
                <p>We want online learning to be a positive experience for you and your child.  
                    Please follow the guidelines below to ensure that virtual learning is <span>safe</span>, <span>supportive</span> and <span>effective</span>.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="g_list_items">
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Meeting Virtually:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h4>For Parents and Students:</h4>
                                <p>To ensure that online learning occurs in a safe, monitored space, 
                                    we require that a parent or another responsible adult remain in the same room or same residence as the student during tutoring sessions. 
                                    The Zoom meeting invitation for each session will be emailed to the parent, who should plan to be on at the start of the call to check in with the tutor. 
                                    If no adult guardian remains in the residence, the call will be ended by the tutor. 
                                    We recommend that the student uses the computer in a common room like a living room, kitchen, 
                                    or other room with an open door so that the parent is able to check in at any point in time.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>For Tutors:</h4>
                                <p>All tutoring sessions should start with the parent checking in with the student and tutor to begin the call. 
                                    Ensure that the parent is present in the residence during tutoring. 
                                    Inform the parent or guardian in advance that the session will be ended if the parent needs to leave the residence. 
                                    Tutors may not do a student’s homework for them, but rather guide them towards finding the answer themselves.</p>
                            </li>
                            
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Advance Scheduling:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h4>For Parents and Tutors:</h4>
                                <p>While we understand the need to be flexible and accommodate schedule changes when possible, 
                                    tutoring is a formal event and needs to be scheduled in advance. 
                                    Please contact your tutor/parent at least 2 hours before a session if you must skip or reschedule. 
                                    Skipping out on sessions without communicating can cause misunderstandings.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                <p>All scheduled communication (tutoring sessions) and any non-scheduled communication (emails, text messages, or phone calls for scheduling purposes) 
                                    must be handled between the tutor and the student’s parent, 
                                    not directly with the student.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>Zoom is the primary video conferencing platform that has been approved by Learning Lodge. 
                                    Parents may opt to use a different platform if they prefer 
                                    if they communicate this with Learning Lodge by email and if the tutor agrees.</p>

                                <h4>For Parents and Students:</h4>
                                <p>Although your child is at home during this communication, 
                                    it is important that they wear clothing and conduct themself as they would at school. 
                                    Be aware of the student’s surroundings and do not share private or 
                                    inappropriate information through background noise or visuals.</p>

                                <p>Although you and your student are at home during this communication, 
                                    it is important to still wear clothing and conduct yourself as you would at school. 
                                    Make sure that you are in an appropriate space in your home (such as a living room or kitchen), 
                                    that you are aware of your surroundings, and that you do not share private or inappropriate information through background noise or visuals. 
                                    In order to minimize distractions or unintentional sharing, plan ahead with other members of your residence, 
                                    close unused tabs in your browser, turn off notifications before sharing your screen.</p>

                                    Additionally, you may not disclose any personally-identifiable information about a student (including but not limited to
